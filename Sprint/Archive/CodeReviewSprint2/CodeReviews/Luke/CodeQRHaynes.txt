Comments on Code quality (line numbers):
- Private class members is good (19 - 28)
- Class has a lot of parameters (31)
- Good use of comments throughout code 
- Lots of random white space

Hypothetical change to file:
- Reduce the parameter list to not be so much, the way the code is set up, this would not be an easy change
