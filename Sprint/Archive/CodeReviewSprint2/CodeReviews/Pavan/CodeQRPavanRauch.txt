Comments on Code Quality:

- Class is handling data by registering all projectile commands.
	this shouldn't be done in this class, as it splits our data problem across multiple files.
	
- ProjectileSystem is a Middle Man between Player and SimpleProjectileFactory.
	every method call to this class is passed along in some form.
	this increases complexity in our code.

- Switch case is used to choose projectile shot direction
	because Character.Directions is an enum, this is unavoidable.

Recommended Changes:

- Remove commands from this file and put them with other command registration.

- Consider deleting the ProjectileSystem class altogether and having Player call a ProjectileFactory directly.	
	alternatively, more fuctionality could be added to ProjectileSystem, such as inventory management
	in this case, the file should probably be renamed
	the goal should be to increase cohesion by giving each class a clear role
