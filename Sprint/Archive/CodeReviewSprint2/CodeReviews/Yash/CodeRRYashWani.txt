Comments on Code Readability:

- Class members are appropriately named for clarity.
- There's a lack of comments explaining the thought process behind certain decisions or complex logic.
- The BlueBoomerang class is relatively short and focused, reducing the likelihood of readability issues.
- The Return method has a conditional block without a corresponding else block. Adding a comment to clarify this decision would be helpful.


Recommended Changes:

- Add comments to explain complex logic or decisions.
