Code Quality Comments:

-Code is evently separated in multiple methods

-Need more comments that will help understand the reader

-Could make the if statement in the Arrow function into a separate function

-Good syntax having good white spaces and indentation

-Overall decent class


Hypothetical Change:

-The if statement on 33 - 40 can be changed into another function possibily named ChangeVelocity to increase simplicity, reusability, and readablity
