Author of File: Sam Espanioly

Comments on Code quality:
- High Cohesion
- Loose Coupling
- The constructor of player is large.
- Lots of magic numbers
- The player class in general is very large. And adding the sword code to it makes it even larger.

Changes:
- Line 189 - 205. The switch cases can be replaced with a dictionary. It should be easy to change
- Perhaps more the sprite creation out of the constructor  and make it into a method.
