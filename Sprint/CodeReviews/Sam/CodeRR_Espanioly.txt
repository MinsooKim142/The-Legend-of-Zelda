Name Of File: TakeDamageCommands.cs
Comments: 
The file is very easy to read and understand. One thing I noticed was an unused variable gameTime, but I'm not sure if that's going to be used later.
In the file player.cs TakeDamage function is not too clear but I do see a timer there so it explains the gameTime variable. Needs more comments.

Name Of File: CycleItem.cs
Comments:
The file lacks comments to understand what is going on. 


Over all the code is readable but needs a little bit of comments to make it easier for the reader to understand what is being implemented and done in the code.
