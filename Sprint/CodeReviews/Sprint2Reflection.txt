Things to Improve:
- Testing code to be free of bugs before merging.
- If there are known bugs let the team know.
- Comments on who wrote each file.
- Design out each feature before coding. This will minimize the need to reimplement class do to missing functionally.
- Local merge before making a pull request to reduce merge conflicts issues.

Things done well:
- Communication between team member.
- Teammate helping each other with coding issues.

Do Differently:
- Start Earlier to plan out the design of the project
- Have everyone do the local merge before making a pull request.
