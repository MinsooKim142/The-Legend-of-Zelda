Comments on Code Readability:

CycleTile.cs:
- Class members are intuitively named
- Comments are given to explain thought process
	One comment mentions enemies isntead of tiles
- Potentially repetitive tile instantiation is abstracted to a CreateTile funtion
	This makes the loaded data much easier to read
	The parameter list for CreateTile() is still very long
	As a Data Clump, it might be beneficial to make a struct with these parameters
- All functions are short, well-named, and easy to understand

Tile.cs:
- Class is short and doesn't do anything outside of its narrow role
	As a result there are no readability issues
- I'm not sure why Tiles need a Physics object


Recommended Changes:
- Make a struct for sprite creation parameters
	This should be part of the Sprite system and be used by this class
- Remove Physics from Tile
